# Chess_Game_Simulation
This is a Chess Game Simulator which Loads Chess Games which were played at some time and now we have those games in form of lines. Those Lines are stored in a Text File and we can open that file in this Application so that we can see the full game using visuals and we don't have to read text to understand the game.
